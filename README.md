# Phantom Token NGINX Module

NGINX module that introspects access tokens according to [RFC 7662](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662).

This module, when enabled, filters incoming requests, denying access to those which do *not* have a valid `Authorization: Bearer` header. From this header, the access_token is extracted and introspected using the configured endpoint. Curity replies to this request according to the standard. For an active access token, the body of Curity's response contains the JWT that replaces the access token in the header of the request that is forwarded to the back-end. If the token is not valid or absent, no request to the back-end is made and the caller is given a 401, unauthorized, error.

## Configuration Directives

### Required Configuration Directives

All the directives in this subsection are required; if any of these are omitted, the module will be disabled.

#### phantom_token_client_credential

> **Syntax**: **`phantom_token_client_credential`** _`string`_ _`string`_ 
> 
> **Default**: *`—`*                                                                
> 
> **Context**: `location`                                                           
 
The client ID and secret of the OAuth client which will be used for introspection. The first argument to this directive is the client ID and the second is the secret. If this directive is not configured, then the module will be disabled.

#### phantom_token_introspection_endpoint

> **Syntax**: **`phantom_token_introspection_endpoint`** _`string`_
>
> **Default**: *`—`*
>
> **Context**: `location`

The name of the location that proxies requests to Curity. Note that this location needs to be in the same server as the one referring to it using this directive.

Example configuration:

```nginx
server {
    location /api {
        ...
        phantom_token_introspection_endpoint my_good_location_name_for_curity;
    }
    
    location my_good_location_name_for_curity {
        ...
    }
}
```

### Optional Configuration Directives

The following directives are optional and do not need to be configured.

#### phantom_token_realm

> **Syntax**: **`phantom_token_realm`** _`string`_
> 
> **Default**: *`api`*
> 
> **Context**: `location`

The name of the protected realm or scope of protection that should be used when a client does not provide an access token.

Example configuration:

```nginx
location / {
   ...
   phantom_token_realm "myGoodRealm";
}   
```

#### phantom_token_scopes

> **Syntax**: **`phantom_token_scopes`** _`string`_
>
> **Default**: *`—`*
>
> **Context**: `location`

The space-separated list of scopes that the server should inform the client are required when it does not provide an access token.

Example configuration:

```nginx
location / {
   ...
   phantom_token_scopes "scope_a scope_b scope_c";
}
```

#### phantom_token_scope

> **Syntax**: **`phantom_token_scope`** _`string`_
>
> **Default**: *`—`*
>
> **Context**: `location`

An array of scopes that the server should inform the client are required when it does not provide an access token. If `phantom_token_scopes` is also configured, that value will supersede these.
 
Example configuration:
 
```nginx
location / {
   ...
   phantom_token_scope "scope_a";
   phantom_token_scope "scope_b";
   phantom_token_scope "scope_c";
}
```

## Sample Configuration

### Simple Configuration
The following is a simple configuration that might be used in demo or development environments where the NGINX reverse proxy is on the same host as the Curity Identity Server:

```nginx
server {
    location /api {
        proxy_pass         https://example.com/api;
        phantom_token_client_credential "client_id" "client_secret";
        phantom_token_introspection_endpoint curity;
    }
    
    location curity {
        proxy_pass "https://curity.example.com/oauth/v2/introspection";
    }
}
```

### Complex Configuration
The following is a more complex configuration where the NGINX reverse proxy is on a seperate host then the Curity Identity Server:

```nginx
server {
    server_name server1.example.com;n
    location /api {
        proxy_pass         https://example.com/api;
        phantom_token_client_credential "client_id" "client_secret";
        phantom_token_introspection_endpoint curity;
        
        phantom_token_realm "myGoodAPI";
        phantom_token_scopes "scope_a scope_b scope_c";
    }
    
    location curity {
        proxy_pass "https://server2.example.com:8443/oauth/v2/introspection";
    }
}

server {
    listen 8443;
    server_name server2.example.com;
    location / {
        proxy_pass "https://curity.example.com";
    }
}
```
        
### More Advanced Configuration (separate servers + cache)
This module takes advantage of NGINX built-in _proxy_cache_ directive. In order to be able to cache the requests made to the introspection endpoint, except of the `proxy_cache_path` in http context and `proxy_cache` in location context, you have to add the following 3 directives in the location context of the introspection endpoint.

- `proxy_cache_methods POST;` POST requests are not cached by default.
- `proxy_cache_key $request_body;` The key of the cache is related to the _access_token_ sent in the original request. Different requests using the same _access_token_ reach the same cache.
- `proxy_ignore_headers Set-Cookie;` NGINX will not cache the response if `Set-Cookie` header is not ignored.

```nginx
http {
    proxy_cache_path /path/to/cache/cache levels=1:2 keys_zone=my_cache:10m max_size=10g
                     inactive=60m use_temp_path=off;
    server {
        server_name server1.example.com;
        location /api {
            proxy_pass         https://example.com/api;
            phantom_token_client_credential "client_id" "client_secret";
            phantom_token_introspection_endpoint curity;
            phantom_token_scopes "scope_a scope_b scope_c";
            phantom_token_realm "myGoodAPI";
        }
        
        location curity {
            proxy_pass "https://server2.example.com:8443/oauth/v2/introspection";
            
            proxy_cache_methods POST;
            proxy_cache my_cache;
            proxy_cache_key $request_body;
            proxy_ignore_headers Set-Cookie;
        }
    }
    
    server {
        listen 8443;
        server_name server2.example.com;
        location / {
            proxy_pass "https://curity.example.com";
        }
    }
}   
```

## Installing    
To build this module, simply do the following:

```sh
./configure
make && make install
```

This will download the NGINX source code if it is not already local. If it is, the location may be provided when prompted. By default, version 1.13.3 will be downloaded; a different version can be fetched by setting `NGINX_VERSION` before running the `configure` script. Any [additional parameters](http://nginx.org/en/docs/configure.html) (e.g., `--prefix`) that NGINX's `configure` script supports can also be provided. When this module's `configure` script is run, it will pass along `--add-module` and `--with-compat` to NGINX's script. It will also ask if debug flags should be enabled; if so, `--with-debug` and certain GCC flags will be passed on to NGINX's `configure` script to make debugging easier. After the script is run, just execute `make && make install`. These too will delegate to NGINX's `Makefile`. After this, the module will be usable and can be configured as described above.

## Testing 
TBD
